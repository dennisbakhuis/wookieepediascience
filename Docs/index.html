In 41 BBY she conceived a son, Anakin Skywalker, who was born without a father. Anakin was the Chosen One destined to bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith. Posessing the highest concentration of midi-chlorians in his blood, Anakin had the potential to become the most powerful Force-sensitive being in the galaxy.

In the conflict\u0027s early stages, Tambor was appointed emir of Ryloth and supervised its occupation by the Separatists, which was fiercely resisted by local Twi\u0027lek freedom fighters led by Cham Syndulla. After defying orders to abandon Ryloth when the tide of battle turned against the Separatists, Tambor was left behind and captured by the Galactic Republic. He was briefly imprisoned on Coruscant before being liberated later in the conflict.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e"}, {"color": "#8ACAE5", "font": {"color": "white"}, "id": "Tam Posla", "label": "Tam Posla", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eTam Posla was a Milvaynian human male from the planet Milvayne.

However, during her coming-of-age ceremony, the hunt leader Skikkesk forced her to kill and skin a baby Wookiee, which Nokk refused to do, leading to a purge of her brood line. Nokk escaped with her life and swore to a life of non-violence thereafter, hunting to capture rather than to kill.

He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi Master Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda\u0027s clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee Tarfful, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.\u003c/td\u003e\n    \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e"}, {"color": "#8ACAE5", "font": {"color": "white"}, "id": "Norra Wexley", "label": "Norra Wexley", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n    \u003ctr\u003e\n      \u003ctd\u003eNorra Wexley  was a female rebel pilot from the planet Akiva who served in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and New Republic during the Galactic Civil War.
